## Team Charter

"Our team's goal is to come up with a smart home solution that makes life easier by using simple sensors in creative ways. Each of us will design our own PCB as part of the system, and by bringing our pieces together, we'll build a working project that saves time, energy, and/or resources."

## Product Mission Statement

"We intend to build a device that uses sensors to make a household task simpler and smarter. By turning data into useful decisions and actions, our project will help people cut down on effort, waste less, and get things done more efficiently."
