## What are we trying to accomplish?

We are trying to build a smart trash system that will help users use their trash can hands free, while sealing in the smells and preventing flies or other insects from getting into the trash. We also want to notify users when the trash can is full without opening the lid and when the trash is almost too heavy for a normal trash bag to handle. 


## What is the community we are trying to serve?

We are trying to serve those who have a hard time opening a trash can lid and throwing trash in with the other, such as elderly people or busy parents. We also want to prevent food waste from sitting in the can for too long to start rotting and attracting flies.

## Vanpopubs

Positive review:

1. “The trash can is easy to set up, pet-proof, and works quietly with a sensitive sensor. Perfect for keeping curious pets out of the trash!” 

2. “Compact and sturdy design that's easy to place in small spaces. They're perfect for hands-free use and I use them in multiple rooms around my home. Good overall size!”

3. “I’ve been really impressed with these touchless trash cans. The battery lasts a long time and the sensor responds quickly.”

Negative review:

1. “Stopped opening properly after a month. Even with new batteries, the lid barely responds."

2. "The batteries overheated and the unit stopped working. I don’t feel safe using it anymore."

3. "The lid is unreliable and the can is smaller than expected. Not happy with the purchase."



## EKO

Positive reviews:

1. “This is the best motion-sensor trash can I’ve used. The sensor works smoothly without random triggers”

2. "After dealing with smaller, frustrating cans, this taller one has been a huge upgrade. It holds a lot and the trash bags come out easily. Worth every penny."

3. "We liked this can so much we bought a second one. It’s simple to load with batteries and bags, opens quietly, and even stands up to our cat sitting on it and triggering the lid."

Negative reviews:

1. "This trash can was a total letdown. It doesn’t seal at all, and the smell spreads through the whole room. It even leaked on my floor because of weird holes in the bottom. Definitely wouldn’t buy this again."

2. “Taking the bag out is a nightmare. Everything gets caught on the rim and rips the bag almost every time. Huge mess. Super annoying."

3. "The lid only closes halfway most of the time, and the bag keeps getting caught on the inside. The metal feels cheap and bends easily. For the price, I expected way better."



## iTouchless

Positive reviews:

1. "I’ve had this trash can for a year and honestly love it. It opens and closes consistently, stays clean, and has worked perfectly since day one. Totally worth it."

2. "Got this for my son who has two curious cats, and it’s been great. The cats haven’t gotten into it once. It’s tall, space-saving, and perfect for small kitchens."

3. "I bought it for the odor control and it really works even with strong smells like cooked veggies. The bag holder is great, and the slow-close lid is a nice touch. All in all, I like it!”


Negative reviews:

1. "At first, the sensor worked okay, but a few months in, it completely stopped responding. I tried replacing the batteries, but nothing fixed it. Then I found out I had to pay extra just to use the warranty. Super frustrating experience for something that’s supposed to be ‘automatic.’”

2. "Every time we throw something away, the bag ring falls into the trash. It makes a huge mess and is a pain to deal with. I end up having to dig into the trash just to fix it. My kids can’t change the bag without help, and even I hate doing it. Definitely not worth it."

3. "The lid that covers the liner doesn't lift high enough, so changing the bag is awkward. Everything else is decent, but the way it’s designed makes a simple task harder than it should be. It’s disappointing, especially since the product photos make it look easier."



## Best Office

Positive reviews:

1. “This trash can has been great so far. The sensor works every time, it fits standard 13-gallon bags, and it looks sleek. Super easy to move and way more convenient than lifting a lid."

2. "Best trash can I’ve used. Hands-free and hassle-free. Just wave and drop your trash in—so much cleaner and easier."

3. “Purchased this trashcan to keep my kitty who sometimes identifies as a dog, out of the trash...
I'm extremely impressed with its functionality, odor control, and it looks good to boot.”

Negative reviews:

1. "The touch-free feature barely works. Sometimes the lid opens, sometimes it doesn't. Tried changing batteries and cleaning the sensor, but it’s just unreliable. I gave up and use it manually now."

2. "Disappointed from the start. It arrived with a strong plastic smell and felt cheap. The sensor is spotty, the lid doesn't fit right, and it uses different batteries than advertised. Just not worth it."

3. “Not good, When I first bought it, it just repeatedly kept opening on its own and was definitely glitching. Was about to return it when it finally started working better so I kept it. But now, just a couple month after purchasing, it is only opening up about an inch and I have to physically open it up the rest of the way, which completely defeats the purpose. Just super glitchy and unreliable.”


## Ninestars

Positive reviews:

1. ”The new sensor design that keeps the lid open as long as it detects you is a total game changer. With our old model, the lid would close too quickly and sometimes make a mess. Now, it stays open until I’m finished, which makes using it so much easier and free of frustration.”

2. “I was skeptical of a trash can needing batteries, but it’s been nearly 13 months on one set of D size batteries. In our house with 10 people, that kind of battery life deserves 5 stars.”

3. “The soft-closing lid is a huge plus. No more clanging noises in my open-concept kitchen, just quiet, smooth operation every time.“


Negative reviews:

1. "The lid started failing after just a few months. Sometimes it opens really slowly, other times not at all. Even new batteries didn’t help, and support’s reset instructions didn’t fix anything. It’s just not dependable."

2. "After about a year, the motor on ours started wearing out. The lid now only opens halfway, and it’s clearly struggling. The size and look are fine, but it’s disappointing how quickly the mechanical parts gave out.".

3. "This trash can is honestly infuriating. The sensor reacts way too fast. it snaps shut before you can toss anything in. And if you use it twice in a row, it locks up and won’t open for 20 seconds. I regret not going with a better model."
