### Main Method for Group Communication

Based on the information provided on in the "Team Member Communication Modes," the group primary method of communication is TEXT.
 
## Communication Procedures

1. How will your team communicate? Through text.
2. How will you handle instructor correspondence? Who is responsible? How will that be communicated with/back to the group?
   We will handle instructor correspondence however necessary, whether that be through email, in-person during class time, etc.
   Everyone in the group is responsible. It will be communicated by us sharing what was told to us in a group chat.

## Meeting Coordination

1. What method will you use to remind yourselves of meetings (a shared calendar?)
Group chat.

2. How will your team go about changing or adding meeting times?
Discussion and consensus.

3. What's the preferred format for meetings (face-to-face or virtually)?
Depends on how much work needs to be done and what kind of work (e.g. just paperwork or actual building/designing)

4. Are there any other procedures that your team feels are necessary?
As of right now, no.

## Roles & Responsibilities

_**Appendix Table 2**: Project Roles and Duties_

| **Role**          | **Duties**                                                                                                                                |
| :---------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Meeting leader    | Schedules team meetings, creates and distributes an agenda for each meeting, and runs each meeting                                        |
| Meeting recorder  | Takes minutes of each team meeting, including attendance, and records action items and to whom they are assigned                          |
| Assignment leader | Coordinates the team's work on a given assignment to Canvas before the due date                                                           |
| Project monitor   | Tracks the team's progress relative to the project schedule (Gantt chart) and keeps team members apprised of deadlines and project status |

The roles in the above table all seem fair, so we will just leave them as that.

## Conflict Recognition & Resolution

If any conflicts arise. We will schedule an in-person meeting outside of class with all of the team members. We will then discuss our conflict and come up with a resolution that allows us to continue to function as a team. Any resolutions made will be added to our Team Organization Appendix.
