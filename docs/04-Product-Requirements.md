## Project AutoCan
**Team 202**

## Introduction

Trash cans are one of the most commonly interacted with devices customers use in their homes. Being the place where we put our undesirables, trash cans aren’t something we like to stay close to for extended periods of time. Our research shows that users express a desire for their trash cans to hold whatever they put in it while containing any unpleasant sight and odor. Users also desire the easiest access to their trash cans in order to quickly dispose of their undesirable objects. These desires will be met using the Microchip PIC18F57Q43 Microcontroller, IR distance sensors, weight sensor, and servo motor.

## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to use microcontroller, sensor, and actuator technologies to develop a convenient, durable, cleanly, and functional trash. Our target is to break into the mainstream smart trash can market with 100+ units sold by marketing towards those with busy lives and desire for more convenience when it comes to throwing trash away. With our new product, we aim to at least match the performance, usability and durability of our competitors like EKO and NineStars. In order to gain a better reputation than our competitors, we will ensure our device can be handled roughly without breaking and can handle regular maintenance with ease. 

## Stakeholders

- **Target group** Homeowners with pets, parents and elderly users.
- **Target purchaser** Specifically elderly users and possibly disabled people because these trash cans will minimize the amount of direct contact needed to open/interact with the trash can. Also homeowners with pets or little children that can tip over or get into the trash can.
- **Customer service** Prefers an easy-to-repair product that is made from recyclable parts. Complaints should be simple to fix to match the user-friendly experience people expect from modern smart products.
- **Marketing & Sales division** Looks for clear selling points like clean design, quiet operation, and smart features that match the lifestyle of people who value convenience and smart technology.
- **Retailers** Prefer products that can withstand a wide range of storage conditions including variations in temperature, vibration, humidity, and atmospheric pressure, and have a strong and compact, theft, and vandalism-proof packaging.


## Use Cases

**User Story #1: Gwen**
Gwen is a 26-year-old graphic designer who works from home and shares her space with two curious cats, Miso and Bean. Between tight deadlines and video calls, she doesn’t have time to constantly keep an eye on the trash. The smart trash can she recently got has made a huge difference. It opens with just a wave of her hand which means she can toss scraps while cooking without touching anything.

Gwen's cats used to tip over her old trash can or dig through the bag but the new one automatically seals itself after every use and keeps everything contained and odor-free. It also alerts her when the bag is full or getting too heavy so she no longer has to second guess or deal with leaks.

Sometimes she has friends over for weekend brunch and they always comment on how sleek and modern her trash can looks. Gwen loves that it blends into her kitchen setup but still makes her life noticeably easier. It’s become one of those unexpected home upgrades she can’t stop recommending to fellow pet parents.

**User Story #2: Debra**
Debra is a 72-year-old grandmother who lives alone. After a recent knee replacement surgery, she’s been moving a bit slower and finds herself relying more on household items that make daily life easier. One thing she always struggled with was taking out the trash. Bending over, wrestling with the lid, or trying to hold it open while scraping leftovers off plates was nearly impossible.

That changed when her daughter gifted her a smart trash can. Now, Debra doesn’t have to lift a finger. The lid opens automatically when she waves her hand and it closes on its own without slamming shut. The trash can also lock in odors which is a relief since Debra cooks often and doesn't take the trash out every day. Plus, Debra no longer has to guess when the bag is full because a little light lets her know so she never ends up overfilling it.

She does not worry about confusing technology because the trash can is easy to use and does not need a phone app. It just works. Debra says it is one of the few new gadgets that really feels like it was made for her. She even told her neighbor “If everything in the house worked this easily, I’d be living in the future.”


## Aspects



1. **Product Design**

      * The new product design will be based on that of a 13 gallon RubberMaid trash can with improvements based on the following requirements:
* The product shall be distinguishable as a Team 202 product without looking at the logo
* The product shall be easy to disassemble, deep clean, then reassemble, without damaging its function.
* The product shall be rectangular enough in shape to fit into corners without compromising space efficiency
* The product shall hold up to 15 pounds of trash.

  
1. **Functionality**

      * The product shall have an automatically closing lid.
* The product shall be odor-resistant.
* The product shall be durable.
* The product shall keep out children and pets.
 
1. **Interactivity** 

      * The product shall allow the lid to open automatically using motion detection (via IR sensor) when a user’s hand or object approaches within a defined range.
* The product shall provide manual override buttons (open/close) on the exterior, allowing users to interact with the trash can even if the sensor fails (via  weight sensor) and notify the user with an LED indicator or alert.
* The product shall offer feedback through visual or audible (e.g., LED indicator or soft beep) to confirm successful interaction such as lid opening, full
* The product shall detect when full and alert the user.
* The product’s user interface shall be intuitive for all users after a single moment of learning how it works. 
* The product shall allow users to adjust sensor sensitivity or alerts.
* The product shall prevent accidental lid openings from irrelevant movements.

1. **Customization** 

      * The product shall be available in two colors, black and white.
* The product shall have sensors that will have adjustable sensitivity for opening.

1. **Manufacturing**

      * The total FOB cost price of the product shall be <$50.
* Parts must be mass-producible in batches of 100 parts.
* Functioning of the device shall be easy to check by the manufacturer.

1. **Safety**

      * The product shall have rounded edges.
* The product shall provide protection from overcurrent going to the motors and other electronic components.
* The product shall have a “lock mode” to protect against pets.
* The product shall have a manual open/close button in the case of a sensor malfunction or other reason.
* The product shall have a sensor to check for if there is something in the way of the lid. 
* The product shall not close hard enough to injure someone.


## Requirement Criteria Specifications

* The product must prevent pets from accessing the contents.
* The product must have safety measures to prevent injury to the user.
* The product must be able to hold 15 pounds of trash.
* The product shall stop closing if 2 pounds of resistance is detected.
* The product’s lid shall open within 2 seconds of user interaction.
* The product shall withstand 100,000 open/close cycles without failure.
* The product’s user sensor shall reach 2 feet from the device.


## Open Questions

* What kind of pivots can we make in case early user evaluations prove the product undesirable?
* What is the ideal bin capacity (in liters) to balance household use with compact design?
* Should the trash bag replace system be standard (universal bags) or proprietary (custom-fit bags)?
* How can we ensure safe disposal of electronic components at end-of-life?
